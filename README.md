# Sinatra with SQL Homework
## About the Project
The aim of the project, set on Friday the 24th, was to create a full stacked web application using Sinatra. My application was based on animals, which listed out all the animals within a made up zoo. The information for each animal were stored up on a SQL database, which allowed me to store their names, age, type, class and description. The application had to be nicely styled using static assets CSS.
